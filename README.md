## Building
This project uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io) to generate the build files for your specific development environment.

When cloning this project, make sure to clone it recursively, because olcPixelGameEngine is included as submodule.

### Linux (Make)
Assuming you already have a C++ compiler installed. If you don't, your system package manager should have one.  
I use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), but you can also use [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), for example.

1. Install [Premake](https://premake.github.io/download). Your package manager will probably have this, too
